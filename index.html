                    <p>Hi! My name is Tanner Millican. I'm 24, married, and have three cats. I've had quite a few jobs,
                        but my
                        most
                        recent one was as a POS field technician. I've always had a great fondness for computers and
                        technology
                        in
                        general. I love all forms of art, especially creating it. Drawing and painting are my absolute
                        favorite
                        forms of making art. In fact, as a small child, my dream was to become a famous artist on the
                        level of
                        Michelangelo, Van Gogh, and the like.
                    </p>

            </div>

            </br>

            <p>One of my favorite activities is playing an online MMORPG called Runescape. I've played it since I was at
                least
                12. I often find myself getting lost in it for hours on end before realizing just how much time has
                passed. I
                also think it served as a great gateway into my most recent obsession.
            </p>

            <p>That obsession would be Dungeons and Dragons. I absolutely love the concept of a table top RPG. And being
                set
                in fantasy medieval times, Dungeons and Dragons really struck a cord with me. Sadly, my group has
                dissolved and
                I've had trouble finding another group to play in (seeing as how I live in such a small town).
